# LittleHelpMVC
My project plan is to build a web app called "LittleHelp" using C#/.Net. This app helps the users to fetch information like name, contact info and comments about the home service providers like handymen, plumbers, lawn mowers, babysitters, housecleaners etc. 
The service providers need a valid credentials to enter their details in the LittleHelp DB. The users after they avail the service can enter their feedback.
